# Bible Application Redesign - Complete Overhaul ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
I have completely redesigned the read (chapter), search, and overview (grid) pages from scratch while preserving all their functionality. The new designs eliminate interference with new features while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED
- **Fixed passage navigation**: Form fields now use correct IDs (`#book`, `#chapter`, `#select_version`)
- **Fixed JavaScript integration**: Updated chapter_reader.js to find the correct form elements
- **Fixed Study dropdown**: Ensured base template JavaScript loads properly with `{% block nav_script %}`
- **Fixed form structure**: Separated navigation and passage forms for better functionality
- **Verified all pages working**: Read, Search, and Overview pages all functional
