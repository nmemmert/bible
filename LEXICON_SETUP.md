# Exhaustive Lexicon Setup Guide

This guide explains how to create a comprehensive Greek and Hebrew lexicon for your Bible study application using Strong's Concordance data.

## Current Status

Your application currently has a basic lexicon with ~10 sample entries. To make it exhaustive, you need the complete Strong's Concordance data.

## Obtaining Strong's Data

### Option 1: Public Domain Sources
Strong's Concordance data is in the public domain. You can find comprehensive datasets from:

1. **OpenBible.info** - Free Strong's data in various formats
2. **BibleHub.com** - Web scraping (not recommended for production)
3. **STEPBible.org** - Academic resources with lexicon data
4. **GitHub repositories** - Search for "strongs-concordance" or "lexicon-data"

### Option 2: Manual Data Entry
For smaller implementations, you can gradually add entries as needed.

## Data Format

The lexicon expects entries in this JSON format:

```json
{
  "strongs_number": "G25",
  "original_word": "ἀγαπάω",
  "transliteration": "agapao",
  "pronunciation": "ag-ap-ah'-o",
  "part_of_speech": "verb",
  "definition": "to love (in a social or moral sense)",
  "usage": "From agape; to love (in a social or moral sense): - (be-) love(-ed).",
  "language": "greek"
}
```

## Using the Import Script

1. **Prepare your data file** (e.g., `strongs-complete.json`):
```json
{
  "greek": [
    // Greek entries array
  ],
  "hebrew": [
    // Hebrew entries array
  ]
}
```

2. **Run the import script**:
```bash
node exhaustive_lexicon_import.js
```

## Expected Comprehensive Counts

- **Greek (NT)**: ~5,500+ entries (G1-G5624)
- **Hebrew (OT)**: ~8,000+ entries (H1-H8674)
- **Total**: ~13,500+ unique entries

## Performance Considerations

With a full lexicon:
- Database size: ~10-20MB
- Search performance: Fast with proper indexing
- Memory usage: Minimal for web app

## Integration with Existing Features

The exhaustive lexicon will automatically work with:
- ✅ Lexicon.vue component (search/browse)
- ✅ WordStudies.vue component (linking)
- ✅ Bible text integration (Strong's number lookup)

## Next Steps

1. Obtain comprehensive Strong's data
2. Format it according to the schema
3. Run the import script
4. Test search and integration features
5. Consider adding morphological data for advanced features

## Advanced Features to Consider

Once you have exhaustive data, you can add:
- Morphological analysis
- Word frequency statistics
- Cross-reference linking
- Semantic domain grouping
- Historical linguistics data
