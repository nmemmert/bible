        <p>This is a translation of the Bible based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. Care has been taken to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. The grammar has not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.<br><br>
        The American King James version of the Bible was placed into the public domain on November 8, 1999.<br><br>

Darby also published translations of the Bible in French and German.<br><br>J. N.

In his own oral ministry he generally used the English KJV Bible.<br><br>This Bible is in the public domain in the United States.</p>
